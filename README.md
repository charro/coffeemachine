# coffeemachine
Code for the Coffee Machine Kata: http://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/

Motivation: Check how long it takes to make the Kata and also to get some practice with Rust and TDD

It took me around 2-3 hours to make the first 3 iterations and another 30-40 mins to make the 4th one. I needed to learn
first about unit testing in Rust and this is included in the total time.

It took me another 2-3 hours to make the 5th iteration. It was much harder as I needed to learn and practice with Mocking 
libs in Rust and also learn about how to have references to traits into a struct, as it was required to mock the 
services for the tests of this iteration.
